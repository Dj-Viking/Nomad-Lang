# Nomad Lang
* A language learning game where users can customize their own flashcards. Organized in categories by language. View cards from certain languages by selecting the category within the sidebar.

# Deployed application 
* <a href="https://nomad-lang.herokuapp.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  On Heroku
</a>

# Motivation
* As an enthusiastic traveler and curious learner about the world. I wanted a tool that I could use offline without internet while on the go to practice vocabulary of cards that I created previously while having internet. I have used this before while on an airplane with no internet. The PWA cached version of the deployed application will work without internet and all the cards are stored within the application service worker.

# Usage

# Coming soon

* Statistics tracking - the app will track how often the user has correctly answered the translation and will display the words that need more work more often.
